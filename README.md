# Privacy Policy for Reading Log Chrome Extension
Last updated: 04/22/2025

Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains how the Reading Log Chrome Extension (‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúour,‚Äù or ‚Äúus‚Äù) collects, uses, and discloses your information when you use our extension.

1. Information We Collect
We collect the following types of information:
  User-provided data: When you enter information such as book titles, authors, notes, or dates read, this information is stored on the developers firestore project under a uid associated with your google account, although we do not collect any username email or password information.
  Permissions-based data: Our extension may request access to tabs or browsing activity solely for the purpose of identifying reading-related content (e.g., word count, book title). This access is never used to track you and is only used to enhance your reading log experience.
  Automatically collected data: We may collect non-identifiable data such as extension errors or basic usage metrics (e.g., feature usage frequency) using tools like Chrome‚Äôs built-in analytics services. This helps improve functionality but does not identify you personally.

2. How We Use the Information
We use the collected information to:
  Enable and improve features of the extension such as tracking books read or saving reading history.
  Provide a personalized user experience (e.g., remembering your reading entries).
  Maintain the performance and security of the extension.
  To authenticate you using your Google account.
  To associate your activity and logs with your account.
  To store and retrieve your logs securely from our database (Google Firestore).
  To improve the performance and functionality of our app and understand usage patterns for future updates and improvements.

4. Information Sharing and Disclosure
We do not sell or share your personal data with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes. We may disclose non-personally identifiable data:
  To comply with legal obligations.
  To enforce our Terms of Service.
  To diagnose and resolve technical issues.

5. Data Storage and Retention
All data is stored securely in Google Firestore, a NoSQL cloud database provided by Google Cloud. Your logs are saved in a private collection that is associated with your unique Google user ID. Only you can access this data after signing in. We implement industry-standard security practices to protect your data, including:
  Authentication via Google Sign-In (OAuth 2.0).
  Access control via Firebase security rules.

7. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We‚Äôll notify users of significant changes through the extension or via the Chrome Web Store page.
